# Capstone-Project-Module-1-Simple-Coffee-Shop-Cashier-Program-

I created a simple cashier program for a coffee shop. This code has the following functions:
1. Show all items
2. Add new items
3. Edit items
4. Delete items
5. Exit the program

I also added a login feature, so the user has to enter the correct ID and password in order to access the program.
